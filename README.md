My group and I are actively engaged in the documentation and development of a thorough database for our dental company.

We've decided to introduce valuable features such as the "Inventory" and "Compensation" entities to optimize business operations and streamline payroll processes.

Addressing specific requirements and assumptions related to invoices, medical history, employee details, appointments, and more, we aim to create a comprehensive and interconnected system. 

Our goal is to enhance efficiency in managing dental operations, patient information, and overall business logistics.
